# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
To provide further analysis on the irregularities of Thomas High School ninth gradersâ€™ Math and Reading scores. There are a few student scores missing preventing accurate information from being reported on their overall performance in these two disciplines. First, we will replace the missing ninth-grade scores with NaN and rerun the analysis. Second, repeat the school district analysis, and finally, provide a written report.   

## Resources
* Data Source: `PyCitySchools.ipynb` file 
* Software: Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas

## Deliverable 1: Replace Ninth-Grade Reading and Math Scores with NaN
By replacing the missing information on the student scores with NaN (Not A Number) will allow for more accurate overall reporting of how well the ninth grade students are performing in the area of Reading and Math.

# Deliverable 2: Repeat the School District Analysis

* District Summary  
* School Summary
* Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
* Average math score for each grade level from each school
* Average reading score for each grade level from each school
* Scores by school spending per student
* Scores by school size
* Scores by school type
 
## Deliverable 2 Results with detail analysis:
### 1. District Performance Summary.
Below is an image of the output of the District Summary Dataframe detailing out the overall performance of the District and how well the students are doing.

### 2. The School Performance Summary.
The image of the School Performance Summary provides a window as to how well the fifteen (15) schools are performing against their peers, as well as breaking down by the type of schools. The top performing high schools were all charter school, while the bottom performing high schools were district schools.

### 3. The top 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate.
The top five performing high schools in the PyCity School District are: 
* Cabrera High School
* Thomas High School
* Griffin High School
* Wilson High School
* Pena High School

### 4. The bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate.
The bottom five performing high schools in the PyCity School District are: 
* Rodriguez High School
* Figueroa High School
* Huang High School
* Hernandez High School
* Johnson High Schools

### 5. The average math score for each grade level from each school.
We also drilled down into how each school was doing in Math by grade to further access the school performance in teaching the subject as well as how the students were performing against their peers.

### 6. The average reading score for each grade level from each school.
We are including a breakdown into how each school was doing in Reading by grade to further access the school performance in teaching the subject and the students performance in the subject matter.

### 7. The scores by school spending per student.
The information below on how much was spent per student shows that the Charter Schools spent less than the District Schools, while the Charter School out performed the District Schools.  A deeper dive into the data is required to see where the cost benefits can be found.

### 8. The scores by school size.
The students of the Small and Medium Schools performed better than the Large Schools.  Looking at the number per class may assist in finding why that is, or possibly looking at building additional schools and shifting students to other schools so they would have the same benefits as the students in the Small to Medium schools.

### 9. The scores by school type.
As we have seen above Charter Schools out perform the District Schools.  Their size and student to teacher ratio require looking at, in order to see how their model can benefit the students going to District Schools.  

![Types_of_Schools_Performance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17502725/143725318-182cebe9-c6b9-4c0a-8fe7-3eeb5d23468e.PNG)

In conclusion, the size of a school, student to teacher ratio, the cost of building additional schools, and how we can use dollars more appropriatly will help in bring the districts standards up.  In doing so will attract other families to move to the district and increasing taxable revenue to help fund building additional schools.
